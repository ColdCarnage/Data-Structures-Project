In this program we get the name of a file as the input ,and check if the parenthesis are balanced or not.
It uses the linked list implementation of stack to check if the parenthesis are balanced or not,The program pushes the symbol into stack if it encounters a opening bracket and pops if it encounters a closing parenthesis.If when reaching EOF the stack is NULL then the file parenthesis are balanced else they are not balanced.
