# Data-Structures-Project
Project for Data Structures[Sem-3]
## **Problem Statement 1:**
### *Simple Compiler*
Implement a simple compiler which check whether the parenthesis used in the program is balanced or not. Get an expression string as an input to your project implement a compiler to examine whether the pairs and the orders of expression are correct.

*Note: The expression only contains the characters such as {“, “}”, “(“, “)”, and “[“, “]”.*
## **Problem Statement 2:**
### *Process Queue*
Implement a Queue in order to execute the process in your operating system based on the priority. The process with highest priority will be executed first always. Once the process is executed the same will be removed from queue. You should keep track of the next highest priority process after execution of every process.

*Hint:In order to solve this problem, you should implement a maxheap for all process with its priority.*
